	description `Obsessed with trade and exports the population of X-283N1 has no time for politics and regulations. They're unified under CEO Arnan de Gans who runs the planet. Whatever goes for a government on the bustling planet is modeled like a corporate aboard of directors which answers only to CEO Arnan de Gans.`
	description `The self-appointed CEO expects his planet to be profitable and prosperous. Some say X-283N1 is the most prosperous trading powerhouse in the known galaxy.`
	description `Keep an eye out for Arnan as he is sometimes seen in and around Alpha Centauri with his ship the 'StarGoose'. Hail him and say Hi sometime.`
	spaceport `You find the spaceport divided in 2 sectors; A modern looking area packed with warehouse for trading goods and terminals for handling passenger transports this port is situated in a huge industrious area.`
	spaceport `Separated from the main spaceport you notice a mostly military area which appears to be the base for the defense force. But some small trade vessels can be seen there as well.`
