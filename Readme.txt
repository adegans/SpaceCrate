- WHAT TO EXPECT FROM SPACECRATE

SpaceCrate is a trade mod focused on lucrative deals from a trade hub perspective.
I've added a rich planet called X-283N1 whose people are obsessed with trade and exports.
An implied silly 'narrative' exists appointing Arnan (me) as its CEO running the place. 
The people on X-283N1 love trade and exports so much that they have no time for petty 
politics. All they want is to ship stuff to the galaxy. And they're willing to pay.

The riches this implies of-course attracts workers from all over the galaxy (passenger jobs 
in most human systems) this in turn results in shipments of all sizes being produced ready 
for export (cargo jobs). Higher paying and more challenging jobs (bulk shipments/rush jobs) 
are unlocked as your combat rating goes up. With all common jobs accessible once you reach 
level 10. 

With doing jobs and to some extend killing pirates you gain reputation with SpaceCrate Inc.
Once your reputation is sufficiently highCEO Arnan sends out a recruiter to give you a job 
with a salary through a basic story line. Completing the story line will unlock even larger 
and riskier jobs normally reserved for the inner circle of SpaceCrate.

Other than a few illicit jobs you will not find fighting jobs or other combat related 
activities in this plugin as that is not what this mod is for. Instead the mod relies on 
already available mechanics to create a (pirate) threat for your growing merchant fleet. 
The planet does have a sizable defense force that will attack you like a bunch of mad 
pirates should you contest the planet.

You'll see CEO Arnan fly in and around Alpha Centauri in his ship 'StarGoose' encouraging 
you to visit his planet and make some money if you hail him.

SpaceCrate is a bit of an experiment with how the plugin system works.

If you find any balancing issues, for example ridiculous rewards or shipments that never fit
into your hold... Let me know. I'm making things up as I go along and some of the numbers 
don't mean a whole lot to me, yet!
