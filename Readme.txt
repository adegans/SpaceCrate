- WHAT TO EXPECT FROM SPACECRATE

SpaceCrate is a trade mod focused on lucrative deals from a trade planet perspective.
In Alpha Centauri you'll find a rich planet called X-283N1 whose people are obsessed with
trade and exports. An implied silly 'narrative' exists appointing Arnan (me) as its CEO
running the place. The people on X-283N1 love trade and exports so much that they have no
time for petty politics. All they want is to ship stuff to the galaxy. And they're willing
to pay.

Their obsession with exports requires a lot of imports as well. Notably raw materials. You
will find Bulk Deliveries aimed at X-283N1 throughout many systems, as well as prospecting
passengers who want to travel to the planet to find a new career. This in turn results in
shipments of all sizes being ready for export. Higher paying and more challenging jobs are
unlocked as your reputation and combat rating goes up.

You gain reputation with SpaceCrate Inc. by doing jobs and to some extend killing pirates.
Once your reputation is sufficiently high CEO Arnan sends out a recruiter to give you a job
with a salary through a basic story line. Completing the story line successfully will
unlock employee missions, which are larger and riskier jobs normally reserved for the inner
circle of SpaceCrate.

Other than a few illicit jobs you will not find fighting missions or other combat related
activities in this plugin as that is not what this mod is for. Instead the mod relies on
already available mechanics to create a (pirate) threat for your growing merchant fleet.
The planet does have a sizable defense force that will attack you like a bunch of mad
pirates should you contest the planet. Some jobs require a combat rating to be offered.

You'll see CEO Arnan fly in and around Alpha Centauri in his ship 'StarGoose' encouraging
you to visit his planet and make some money. Regular trade fleets can be seen flying near
Alpha Centauri sometimes with witty remarks or hints about the various jobs and perks
SpaceCrate has to offer.

SpaceCrate is a bit of an experiment with how the plugin system works.

don't mean a whole lot to me, yet!
